# WEATHER APP #
## ABOUT ##
The weather app offers real-time and 7-day forecast weather information for a specific location.
This weather application was created by integrating two APIs: one for weather data and another for geolocation. These APIs offer users access to information such as the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, assisting them in planning their daily activities and making well-informed decisions based on weather conditions.
